contents:

* basic stuff / intro
* dynamical systems / recurrence plots
* multiple dispatch, and its effectiveness (a lot from stefan's talk)
* code performance and optimization ? (too much for the rp8 imo)
* Packages (useful ecosystem stuff) -> this can be sub part of multiple dispatch or directly after multiple dispatch
  * iterative solvers (nice exercise with strang matrix)
  * distributions
  * ordinary diff eq + measurements
  * Dataframes?
